///Use this file to define custom RNG domains for StatelessRNG as showcased below:
///
///UserDefinedDomain1
///UserDefinedDomain2
///...
///
/// ATTENTION: Do NOT change the order of your domain entries in any way after generating them!
/// This is crucial to maintaining determinism across versions, or even during production.
/// If you no longer want to use a generated domain, remove all references to it and rename it
/// (to something like "Unused_Domain_X") in this file, then re-generate this enum.
